Calendar for sports events. Events may be added to the calendar and categorized based on sports

<hr>
1. Coding Exercise 
Goal is to implement a calendar for sport events. Events may be added to the calendar and it 
should be possible to categorize the events based on sports. 
<br />
Examples: 
<li> Sat., 18.07.2019, 18:30, Football, Salzburg – Sturm 
<li> Sun., 23.10.2019, 09:45, Ice Hockey, KAC - Capitals 
<br />
2. Task 1 – Modelling
Start with identifying the database entities and then create a suitable database diagram (ERD). 
The ERD should cover all tables and their relations. 
Furthermore, the database should contain additional information, which may be valuable for the 
sport calendar.
<br />
3. Task 2 – DB Structure/Data
<br />
Create a database following the structure of your ERD. Add all necessary fields to the tables. 
Foreign keys should be named with a ‘_’ as prefix (Example: _FOREIGNKEY).
<br />
4. Task 3 – Implementation
<br />
Create a HTML frontend to display the data in a user-friendly way. Navigation should be 
indicated but no functionality is needed. 
Then go on with the dynamic display of data – avoid SQL queries within loops! 
<br />
Required parts: 
<br />
<li>Database connection 
<li>SQL query 
<li> Data output 
<br />
<li>Additional filters can be added to the calendar presentation.
