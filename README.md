Calendar for sports events. Events may be added to the calendar and categorized based on sports

1. Coding Exercise 
 
Goal is to implement a calendar for sport events. Events may be added to the calendar and it 
should be possible to categorize the events based on sports.  

Examples:  

• Sat., 18.07.2019, 18:30, Football, Salzburg – Sturm 
• Sun., 23.10.2019, 09:45, Ice Hockey, KAC - Capitals 

2. Task 1 – Modelling 
Start with identifying the database entities and then create a suitable database diagram (ERD). 
The ERD should cover all tables and their relations. 
Furthermore, the database should contain additional information, which may be valuable for the 
sport calendar.

3. Task 2 – DB Structure/Data 

Create a database following the structure of your ERD. Add all necessary fields to the tables. 
Foreign keys should be named with a ‘_’ as prefix (Example: _FOREIGNKEY).

4. Task 3 – Implementation  

Create a HTML frontend to display the data in a user-friendly way. Navigation should be 
indicated but no functionality is needed. 
Then go on with the dynamic display of data – avoid SQL queries within loops! 

Required parts:  
* Database connection 
* SQL query 
* Data output 

Additional filters can be added to the calendar presentation
